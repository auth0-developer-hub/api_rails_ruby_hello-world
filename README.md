# Rails/Ruby: Starter API Code Sample

This Ruby code sample demonstrates how to build an API server using Rails that is secure by design.

Visit the ["Rails/Ruby Code Samples: API Security in Action"](https://developer.auth0.com/resources/code-samples/api/railss) section of the ["Auth0 Developer Resources"](https://developer.auth0.com/resources) to explore how you can secure Rails applications written in Ruby by implementing endpoint protection and authorization with Auth0.

## Why Use Auth0?

Auth0 is a flexible drop-in solution to add authentication and authorization services to your applications. Your team and organization can avoid the cost, time, and risk that come with building your own solution to authenticate and authorize users. We offer tons of guidance and SDKs for you to get started and [integrate Auth0 into your stack easily](https://developer.auth0.com/resources/code-samples/full-stack).

## Set Up and Run the Rails Project

Install the project dependencies:

```bash
bundle install
```

Run the application:

```bash
bundle exec rails s
```
